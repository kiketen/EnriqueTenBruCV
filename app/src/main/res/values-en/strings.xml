    <string name="my_description">Age: 29 years\n City of birth: Canals (Valencia)\nCity residence: Madrid\n\nHobbies: Technology, clean programming, android news, practicing sports, classical music (I play the clarinet from 10 years), learn languages ​​and philosophy.\n\nPersonal Description: Since I finished my studies as a telecommunications engineer, I wanted to move around the world of Android technology, so I started to train self-taught in my free time. Four months later I upload my first app at Play Store, Concerts ON.\nThis app was done with a double purpose: to give the smallest groups the chance to advertise and to reach more people and, above all, to learn everything related to The world of mobile application development. \nNowadays, I am working on an Android project and I\'m sure that my professional career is going only in that direction, mobility projects (I am open to learning new technologies: React Native, Xamarin, Swift, AngularJS (I already have some experience in this one). \nI consider myself a proactive and over-enthusiastic person with a lot of desire to learn and continue to grow as a professional. Of course, I see my future beyond being a programmer analyst, as I am today. I would like to take charge of the organization of mobility projects (I have already done it on a small scale, in Correos I have a person in my charge), but I think that to be able to organize a project well, it is necessary to know the technology used in it, so I continue to train day by day, reading weeklies like Android Weekly and following different technology pages on facebook or twitter. \nTo finish, comment that I have good communicative ability, which has always been very useful to me to talk with the client.</string>
